# simple-node-proxy

## NodeJS finally solves same-domain policy problems!

### Planned features
- get remote JSON requests
- get remote XML requests (cast to JSON vis XML2JSON library)
- wrap requests with JSONP
- whitelist/blacklisting of remote resources


### When you need simple-node-proxy
You're writing a client-side only application and need to request remote services that do not provide JSONP, CORS, or other-crazy-server-side solution
